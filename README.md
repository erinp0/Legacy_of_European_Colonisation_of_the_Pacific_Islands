# Uncovering the Legacy of European Colonisation in the Pacific Islands: A Bayesian Approach to Estimating Genetic Mixing Proportions
## Erin Pollard
### Supervisor: D. Lawson
Using a Bayesian approach, the project estimates the genetic profile of surrogate populations based on the birth locations of crew members sourced from Captain Cookâ€™s manifest and modern-day genetic profiles. These profiles are then used to estimate the variation in mixing proportions resulting from the European colonisation of the Pacific Islands.

## Reading order
Within each model folder, there is a Stan file which details the model and an Rscript file where the model is fitted and results are analysed. The models should be followed in a chronological order as supplementary evidence to the project report:
* Model 0
* Model 1
* Model 2
* Model 3
* Manifest Model
