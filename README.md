# Uncovering the Legacy of European Colonisation in the Pacific Islands: A Bayesian Approach to Estimating Genetic Mixing Proportions
## Erin Pollard
### Supervisor: D. Lawson
Using a Bayesian approach, the project estimates the genetic profile of surrogate populations based on the birth locations of crew members sourced from Captain Cookâ€™s manifest and modern-day genetic profiles. These profiles are then used to estimate the variation in mixing proportions resulting from the European colonisation of the Pacific Islands.
